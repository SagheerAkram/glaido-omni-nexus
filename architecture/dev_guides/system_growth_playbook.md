# System Growth Playbook

## Purpose
This playbook lays the operational foundation for expanding the capabilities of the Glaido Omni-Nexus once it graduates past Dormant Maintenance Mode and into actual agentic software creation.

## Structural Overview
Expanding the system hinges on the "Continuous Autonomous Resume Protocol." 

## Interaction Model
- **Blueprint Drafting**: For any major system addition (e.g. 'Project Generator', 'Git Orchestrator'), the AI must first draft a formal specification inside `architecture/specifications/` before writing any functional python payload in `navigation/` or `tools/`.
- **Ecosystem Registry Updates**: Whenever a major structural check or tool is introduced, it must be officially codified inside the system's runtime configurations to prevent 'ghost code' fragments.
- **No Refactoring Under Expanding**: The system is either expanding horizontally (adding features) or vertically optimizing (refactoring/maintenance). It must never aggressively refactor its core logic in the same cycle as adding deep functionality features.

## Future Stability Notes
Unconstrained AI execution typically results in massive technical debt over continuous cycles. By strictly adhering to the Growth Playbook rules—writing specs first, separating read/write cycles, enforcing the B.L.A.S.T. lifecycle—the repository can grow to massive complexity (hundreds of interlinked tools and orchestrated UI commands) while maintaining perfect alignment with identical standard execution contracts.
