# System Evolution Snapshot

## Purpose
This document captures a static snapshot of the Glaido Omni-Nexus at the conclusion of the most recent Autonomous Maintenance Cycle. It serves as a historical marker for the current pipeline health, the verified ecosystem, and the strategic direction before the Expansion Gate is unlocked.

## Structural Overview
As of the current cycle, the system is fiercely protecting its foundational stability. The core rule remains: **A.N.T. Strict Separation** (Architecture defines, Navigation orchestrates, Tools execute) paired with the **B.L.A.S.T. lifecycle protocol**.

## Pipeline & Ecosystem Status
- **Current Mode**: DORMANT MAINTENANCE MODE.
- **Expansion Gate**: LOCKED.
- **Verification Pipeline**: HEALTHY. The system successfully executed end-to-end diagnostic evaluations of workspace hygiene, local dependencies, python packages, filesystem integrity, and semantic syntax.
- **Tools**: 7 active Core Validation tools resolving synchronously strictly via standard library implementations, emitting JSON to stdout without state.
- **Documentation Engine**: Up to 40+ Architectural Maps, SOPs, and Dev Guides cleanly separated to dictate logic instead of hardcoding rules into python.
- **User Interface**: Deterministic terminal UI utilizing robust ANSI configurations isolated in `formatter.py`.

## Architectural Direction
1. **Vertical Strengthening Over Horizontal Bloat**: Expansion Cycle #4 candidates have been successfully identified (Documentation Map Link Validator, `.antigravityignore` Configuration Validator, Agent Tool Isolation Sandbox Validator). These will be sequentially Blueprinted.
2. **Offline-First Resilience**: All verifiers remain completely functional without internet access. This invariant will not be broken during the next Expansion.
3. **Safe Multi-Agent Prep**: The comprehensive ASCII maps (`architecture/visuals/`) and rules defined in Phase A and Phase C lay out exactly how future AI entities will navigate the repository safely.

## Conclusion
The repository has reached an unprecedented level of internal documentation, rule-governance, and stable baseline health. The Omni-Nexus is secure.
